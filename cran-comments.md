R CMD check succeeded

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies:
dplyr
tidyr
lavaan
simstandard
purrr
ggplot2
stats
tibble
patchwork
stringr
magrittr

All packages passed.

## Notes
DFI is a relevant acronym and is not a misspelling.
The examples take several minutes because the package runs a series of time-intensive Monte Carlo simulations for users.
